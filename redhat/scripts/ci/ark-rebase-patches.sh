# Automatically rebase the kernel patches in ark-patches.
#
# If the REPORT_BUGS environment variable is set, any patches that do not apply
# cleanly during the rebase are dropped, and an issue is filed to track rebasing
# that patch.
#
# If run with REPORT_BUGS, you must have python3-gitlab installed and a
# configuration file set up in ~/.python-gitlab.cfg or /etc/python-gitlab.cfg.
# An example configuration can be found at
# https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html. If the configuration
# is not in one of the above locations, the path can be set
# with the PYTHON_GITLAB_CONFIG environment variable.
#
# Arguments:
#   1) The commit/tag/branch to rebase onto.
#   2) The Gitlab project ID to file issues against. See the project page on
#      Gitlab for the ID. For example, https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark/
#      is project ID 13604247

ISSUE_TEMPLATE="During an automated rebase of ark-patches, commit %s failed to rebase.

The commit in question is:
~~~
%s
~~~

To fix this issue:

1. \`git rebase upstream ark-patches\`
2. Use your soft, squishy brain to resolve the conflict as you see fit. If it is
   non-trivial and has an \"Upstream Status: RHEL only\" tag, contact the author
   and ask them to rebase the patch.
3. \`if git tag -v $UPSTREAM_REF; then git branch ark/patches/$UPSTREAM_REF && git push upstream ark/patches/$UPSTREAM_REF; fi\`
4. \`git push -f upstream ark-patches\`
