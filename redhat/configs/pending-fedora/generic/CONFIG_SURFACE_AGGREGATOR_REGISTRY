# CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_REGISTRY:
# 
# Device-registry and device-hubs for Surface System Aggregator Module
# (SSAM) devices.
# 
# Provides a module and driver which act as a device-registry for SSAM
# client devices that cannot be detected automatically, e.g. via ACPI.
# Such devices are instead provided via this registry and attached via
# device hubs, also provided in this module.
# 
# Devices provided via this registry are:
# - Platform profile (performance-/cooling-mode) device (5th- and later
#   generations).
# - Battery/AC devices (7th-generation).
# - HID input devices (7th-generation).
# 
# Select M (recommended) or Y here if you want support for the above
# mentioned devices on the corresponding Surface models. Without this
# module, the respective devices will not be instantiated and thus any
# functionality provided by them will be missing, even when drivers for
# these devices are present. In other words, this module only provides
# the respective client devices. Drivers for these devices still need to
# be selected via the other options.
