# CONFIG_SURFACE_DTX:
# 
# Driver for the Surface Book clipboard detachment system (DTX).
# 
# On the Surface Book series devices, the display part containing the
# CPU (called the clipboard) can be detached from the base (containing a
# battery, the keyboard, and, optionally, a discrete GPU) by (if
# necessary) unlocking and opening the latch connecting both parts.
# 
# This driver provides a user-space interface that can influence the
# behavior of this process, which includes the option to abort it in
# case the base is still in use or speed it up in case it is not.
# 
# Note that this module can be built without support for the Surface
# Aggregator Bus (i.e. CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_BUS=n). In that case,
# some devices, specifically the Surface Book 3, will not be supported.
