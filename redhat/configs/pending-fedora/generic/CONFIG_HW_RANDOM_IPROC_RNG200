# CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_IPROC_RNG200:
# 
# This driver provides kernel-side support for the RNG200
# hardware found on the Broadcom iProc and STB SoCs.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
# module will be called iproc-rng200
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: HW_RANDOM_IPROC_RNG200 [=y]
# Type  : tristate
# Prompt: Broadcom iProc/STB RNG200 support
