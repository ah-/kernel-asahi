# CONFIG_REGULATOR_FAN53880:
# 
# This driver supports Fairchild (ON Semiconductor) FAN53880
# regulator. The regulator is a programmable power management IC
# (PMIC), it is controlled by I2C and provides one BUCK, one BOOST
# and four LDO outputs.
# 
# Symbol: REGULATOR_FAN53880 [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/regulator/Kconfig:339
#   Prompt: Fairchild FAN53880 Regulator
#   Depends on: REGULATOR [=y] && I2C [=y] && (OF [=y] || COMPILE_TEST [=n])
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Voltage and Current Regulator Support (REGULATOR [=y])
# Selects: REGMAP_I2C [=y]
