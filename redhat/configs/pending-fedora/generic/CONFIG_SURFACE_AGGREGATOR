# CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR:
# 
# The Surface System Aggregator Module (Surface SAM or SSAM) is an
# embedded controller (EC) found on 5th- and later-generation Microsoft
# Surface devices (i.e. Surface Pro 5, Surface Book 2, Surface Laptop,
# and newer, with exception of Surface Go series devices).
# 
# Depending on the device in question, this EC provides varying
# functionality, including:
# - EC access from ACPI via Surface ACPI Notify (5th- and 6th-generation)
# - battery status information (all devices)
# - thermal sensor access (all devices)
# - performance mode / cooling mode control (all devices)
# - clipboard detachment system control (Surface Book 2 and 3)
# - HID / keyboard input (Surface Laptops, Surface Book 3)
# 
# This option controls whether the Surface SAM subsystem core will be
# built. This includes a driver for the Surface Serial Hub (SSH), which
# is the device responsible for the communication with the EC, and a
# basic kernel interface exposing the EC functionality to other client
# drivers, i.e. allowing them to make requests to the EC and receive
# events from it. Selecting this option alone will not provide any
# client drivers and therefore no functionality beyond the in-kernel
# interface. Said functionality is the responsibility of the respective
# client drivers.
# 
# Note: While 4th-generation Surface devices also make use of a SAM EC,
# due to a difference in the communication interface of the controller,
# only 5th and later generations are currently supported. Specifically,
# devices using SAM-over-SSH are supported, whereas devices using
# SAM-over-HID, which is used on the 4th generation, are currently not
# supported.
# 
# Choose m if you want to build the SAM subsystem core and SSH driver as
# module, y if you want to build it into the kernel and n if you don't
# want it at all.
