# CONFIG_COMMON_CLK_FSL_SAI:
# 
# This driver supports the Freescale SAI (Synchronous Audio Interface)
# to be used as a generic clock output. Some SoCs have restrictions
# regarding the possible pin multiplexer settings. Eg. on some SoCs
# two SAI interfaces can only be enabled together. If just one is
# needed, the BCLK pin of the second one can be used as general
# purpose clock output. Ideally, it can be used to drive an audio
# codec (sometimes known as MCLK).
# 
# Symbol: COMMON_CLK_FSL_SAI [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at drivers/clk/Kconfig:177
#   Prompt: Clock driver for BCLK of Freescale SAI cores
