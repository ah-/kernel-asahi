# CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_NIOS_INTEL_PAC_N3000:
# 
# This is the driver for the N3000 Nios private feature on Intel
# PAC (Programmable Acceleration Card) N3000. It communicates
# with the embedded Nios processor to configure the retimers on
# the card. It also instantiates the SPI master (spi-altera) for
# the card's BMC (Board Management Controller).
#
