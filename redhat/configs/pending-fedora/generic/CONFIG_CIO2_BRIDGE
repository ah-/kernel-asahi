# CONFIG_CIO2_BRIDGE:
# 
# This extension provides an API for the ipu3-cio2 driver to create
# connections to cameras that are hidden in the SSDB buffer in ACPI.
# It can be used to enable support for cameras in detachable / hybrid
# devices that ship with Windows.
# 
# Say Y here if your device is a detachable / hybrid laptop that comes
# with Windows installed by the OEM, for example:
# 
#       - Microsoft Surface models (except Surface Pro 3)
#       - The Lenovo Miix line (for example the 510, 520, 710 and 720)
#       - Dell 7285
# 
# If in doubt, say N here.
