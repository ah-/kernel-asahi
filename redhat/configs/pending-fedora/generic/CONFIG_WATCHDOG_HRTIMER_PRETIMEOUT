# CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HRTIMER_PRETIMEOUT:
# 
# Enable this if you want to use a hrtimer timer based pretimeout for
# watchdogs that do not natively support pretimeout support. Be aware
# that because this pretimeout functionality uses hrtimers, it may not
# be able to fire before the actual watchdog fires in some situations.
