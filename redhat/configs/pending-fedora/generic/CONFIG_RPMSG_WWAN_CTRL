# CONFIG_RPMSG_WWAN_CTRL:
# 
# RPMSG WWAN CTRL allows modems available via RPMSG channels to expose
# different modem protocols/ports to userspace, including AT and QMI.
# These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace
# (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libqmi, libqcdm...).
# 
# This is mainly used for modems integrated into many Qualcomm SoCs,
# e.g. for AT and QMI on Qualcomm MSM8916 or MSM8974. Note that many
# newer Qualcomm SoCs (e.g. SDM845) still provide an AT port through
# this driver but the QMI messages can only be sent through
# QRTR network sockets (CONFIG_QRTR).
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
# called rpmsg_wwan_ctrl.
