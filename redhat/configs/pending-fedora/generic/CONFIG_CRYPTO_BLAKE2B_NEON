# CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLAKE2B_NEON:
# 
# BLAKE2b digest algorithm optimized with ARM NEON instructions.
# On ARM processors that have NEON support but not the ARMv8
# Crypto Extensions, typically this BLAKE2b implementation is
# much faster than SHA-2 and slightly faster than SHA-1.
# 
# Symbol: CRYPTO_BLAKE2B_NEON [=n]
