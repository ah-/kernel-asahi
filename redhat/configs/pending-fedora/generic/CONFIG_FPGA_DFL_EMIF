# CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_EMIF:
# 
# This driver is for the EMIF private feature implemented under
# FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) framework. It is used to expose
# memory interface status information as well as memory clearing
# control.
# 
# Symbol: FPGA_DFL_EMIF [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/memory/Kconfig:140
#   Prompt: FPGA DFL EMIF Driver
#   Depends on: MEMORY [=y] && FPGA_DFL [=m] && HAS_IOMEM [=y]
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Memory Controller drivers (MEMORY [=y])
