# CONFIG_INTEL_SKL_INT3472:
# 
# This driver adds power controller support for the Intel SkyCam
# devices found on the Intel SkyLake platforms.
# 
# The INT3472 is a camera power controller, a logical device found on
# Intel Skylake-based systems that can map to different hardware
# devices depending on the platform. On machines designed for Chrome OS
# it maps to a TPS68470 camera PMIC. On machines designed for Windows,
# it maps to either a TP68470 camera PMIC, a uP6641Q sensor PMIC, or a
# set of discrete GPIOs and power gates.
# 
# If your device was designed for Chrome OS, this driver will provide
# an ACPI OpRegion, which must be available before any of the devices
# using it are probed. For this reason, you should select Y if your
# device was designed for ChromeOS. For the same reason the
# I2C_DESIGNWARE_PLATFORM option must be set to Y too.
# 
# Say Y or M here if you have a SkyLake device designed for use
# with Windows or ChromeOS. Say N here if you are not sure.
# 
# The module will be named "intel-skl-int3472".
