# CONFIG_INTEL_ATOMISP2_LED:
# 
# Many Bay Trail and Cherry Trail devices come with a camera attached
# to Intel's Image Signal Processor. Linux currently does not have a
# driver for these, so they do not work as a camera. Some of these
# camera's have a LED which is controlled through a GPIO.
# 
# Some of these devices have a firmware issue where the LED gets turned
# on at boot. This driver will turn the LED off at boot and also allows
# controlling the LED (repurposing it) through the sysfs LED interface.
# 
# Which GPIO is attached to the LED is usually not described in the
# ACPI tables, so this driver contains per-system info about the GPIO
# inside the driver, this means that this driver only works on systems
# the driver knows about.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
# will be called intel_atomisp2_led.
