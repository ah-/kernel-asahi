# CONFIG_SND_SOC_TEGRA_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD:
# 
# Config to enable Tegra audio machine driver based on generic
# audio graph driver. It is a thin driver written to customize
# few things for Tegra audio. Most of the code is re-used from
# audio graph driver and the same DT bindings are used.
# 
# Symbol: SND_SOC_TEGRA_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at sound/soc/tegra/Kconfig:111
#   Prompt: Audio Graph Card based Tegra driver
#   Depends on: SOUND [=m] && !UML && SND [=m] && SND_SOC [=m] && SND_SOC_TEGRA [=m] && SND_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD [=m]
