# CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_THERMAL:
# 
# This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through frequency
# reduction. An ACPI version of this already exists
# (drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c).
# This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
# and not the ACPI interface.
# 
# Symbol: CPU_FREQ_THERMAL [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: CPU frequency cooling device
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Generic Thermal sysfs driver (THERMAL [=y])
#         -> Generic cpu cooling support (CPU_THERMAL [=y])
#   Defined at drivers/thermal/Kconfig:162
#   Depends on: THERMAL [=y] && CPU_THERMAL [=y] && CPU_FREQ [=y]
