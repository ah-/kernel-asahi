# CONFIG_SURFACE_HOTPLUG:
# 
# Driver for out-of-band hot-plug event signaling on Microsoft Surface
# devices with hot-pluggable PCIe cards.
# 
# This driver is used on Surface Book (2 and 3) devices with a
# hot-pluggable discrete GPU (dGPU). When not in use, the dGPU on those
# devices can enter D3cold, which prevents in-band (standard) PCIe
# hot-plug signaling. Thus, without this driver, detaching the base
# containing the dGPU will not correctly update the state of the
# corresponding PCIe device if it is in D3cold. This driver adds support
# for out-of-band hot-plug notifications, ensuring that the device state
# is properly updated even when the device in question is in D3cold.
# 
# Select M or Y here, if you want to (fully) support hot-plugging of
# dGPU devices on the Surface Book 2 and/or 3 during D3cold.
