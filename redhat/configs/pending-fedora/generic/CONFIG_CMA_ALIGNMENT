# CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT:
# 
# DMA mapping framework by default aligns all buffers to the smallest
# PAGE_SIZE order which is greater than or equal to the requested buffer
# size. This works well for buffers up to a few hundreds kilobytes, but
# for larger buffers it just a memory waste. With this parameter you can
# specify the maximum PAGE_SIZE order for contiguous buffers. Larger
# buffers will be aligned only to this specified order. The order is
# expressed as a power of two multiplied by the PAGE_SIZE.
# 
# For example, if your system defaults to 4KiB pages, the order value
# of 8 means that the buffers will be aligned up to 1MiB only.
# 
# If unsure, leave the default value "8".
