# CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD:
# 
# ZSTD is a compression algorithm targeting intermediate compression
# with fast decompression speed. It will compress better than GZIP and
# decompress around the same speed as LZO, but slower than LZ4. You
# will need at least 192 KB RAM or more for booting. The zstd command
# line tool is required for compression.
