# CONFIG_ARM_SMMU_LEGACY_DT_BINDINGS:
# 
# Support for the badly designed and deprecated "mmu-masters"
# devicetree bindings. This allows some DMA masters to attach
# to the SMMU but does not provide any support via the DMA API.
# If you're lucky, you might be able to get VFIO up and running.
# 
# If you say Y here then you'll make me very sad. Instead, say N
# and move your firmware to the utopian future that was 2016.
