# CONFIG_QCOM_RPMH:
# 
# Support for communication with the hardened-RPM blocks in
# Qualcomm Technologies Inc (QTI) SoCs. RPMH communication uses an
# internal bus to transmit state requests for shared resources. A set
# of hardware components aggregate requests for these resources and
# help apply the aggregated state on the resource.
