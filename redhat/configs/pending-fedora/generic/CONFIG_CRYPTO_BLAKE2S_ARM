# CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLAKE2S_ARM:
# 
# BLAKE2s digest algorithm optimized with ARM scalar instructions.  This
# is faster than the generic implementations of BLAKE2s and BLAKE2b, but
# slower than the NEON implementation of BLAKE2b.  (There is no NEON
# implementation of BLAKE2s, since NEON doesn't really help with it.)
