# CONFIG_EFI_DISABLE_PCI_DMA:
# 
# Disable the busmaster bit in the control register on all PCI bridges
# while calling ExitBootServices() and passing control to the runtime
# kernel. System firmware may configure the IOMMU to prevent malicious
# PCI devices from being able to attack the OS via DMA. However, since
# firmware can't guarantee that the OS is IOMMU-aware, it will tear
# down IOMMU configuration when ExitBootServices() is called. This
# leaves a window between where a hostile device could still cause
# damage before Linux configures the IOMMU again.
# 
# If you say Y here, the EFI stub will clear the busmaster bit on all
# PCI bridges before ExitBootServices() is called. This will prevent
# any malicious PCI devices from being able to perform DMA until the
# kernel reenables busmastering after configuring the IOMMU.
# 
# This option will cause failures with some poorly behaved hardware
# and should not be enabled without testing. The kernel commandline
# options "efi=disable_early_pci_dma" or "efi=no_disable_early_pci_dma"
# may be used to override this option.
