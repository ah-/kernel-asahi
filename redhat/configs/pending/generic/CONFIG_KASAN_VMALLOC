# CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC:
# 
# By default, the shadow region for vmalloc space is the read-only
# zero page. This means that KASAN cannot detect errors involving
# vmalloc space.
# 
# Enabling this option will hook in to vmap/vmalloc and back those
# mappings with real shadow memory allocated on demand. This allows
# for KASAN to detect more sorts of errors (and to support vmapped
# stacks), but at the cost of higher memory usage.
# 
# Symbol: KASAN_VMALLOC [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Back mappings in vmalloc space with real shadow memory
#   Location:
#     -> Kernel hacking

#   Depends on: KASAN [=y] && HAVE_ARCH_KASAN_VMALLOC [=y]
