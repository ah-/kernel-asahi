# CONFIG_PINCTRL_EQUILIBRIUM:
# 
# Equilibrium pinctrl driver is a pinctrl & GPIO driver for Intel Lightning
# Mountain network processor SoC that supports both the linux GPIO and pin
# control frameworks. It provides interfaces to setup pinmux, assign desired
# pin functions, configure GPIO attributes for LGM SoC pins. Pinmux and
# pinconf settings are retrieved from device tree.
