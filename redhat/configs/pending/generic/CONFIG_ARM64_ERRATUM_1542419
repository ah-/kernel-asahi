# CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_1542419:
# 
# This option adds a workaround for ARM Neoverse-N1 erratum
# 1542419.
# 
# Affected Neoverse-N1 cores could execute a stale instruction when
# modified by another CPU. The workaround depends on a firmware
# counterpart.
# 
# Workaround the issue by hiding the DIC feature from EL0. This
# forces user-space to perform cache maintenance.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_ERRATUM_1542419 [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Neoverse-N1: workaround mis-ordering of instruction fetches
