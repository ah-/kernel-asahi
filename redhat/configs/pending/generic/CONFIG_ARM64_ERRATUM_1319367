# CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_1319367:
# 
# This option adds work arounds for ARM Cortex-A57 erratum 1319537
# and A72 erratum 1319367
# 
# Cortex-A57 and A72 cores could end-up with corrupted TLBs by
# speculating an AT instruction during a guest context switch.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_ERRATUM_1319367 [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Cortex-A57/A72: Speculative AT instruction using out-of-context translation regime could cause subsequent request to generate an incorrect translation
