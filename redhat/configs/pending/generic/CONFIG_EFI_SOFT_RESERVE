# CONFIG_EFI_SOFT_RESERVE:
# 
# On systems that have mixed performance classes of memory EFI
# may indicate specific purpose memory with an attribute (See
# EFI_MEMORY_SP in UEFI 2.8). A memory range tagged with this
# attribute may have unique performance characteristics compared
# to the system's general purpose "System RAM" pool. On the
# expectation that such memory has application specific usage,
# and its base EFI memory type is "conventional" answer Y to
# arrange for the kernel to reserve it as a "Soft Reserved"
# resource, and set aside for direct-access (device-dax) by
# default. The memory range can later be optionally assigned to
# the page allocator by system administrator policy via the
# device-dax kmem facility. Say N to have the kernel treat this
# memory as "System RAM" by default.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
