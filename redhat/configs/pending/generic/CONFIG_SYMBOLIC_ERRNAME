# CONFIG_SYMBOLIC_ERRNAME:
# 
# If you say Y here, the kernel's printf implementation will
# be able to print symbolic error names such as ENOSPC instead
# of the number 28. It makes the kernel image slightly larger
# (about 3KB), but can make the kernel logs easier to read.
# 
# Symbol: SYMBOLIC_ERRNAME [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Support symbolic error names in printf
#   Location:
#     -> Kernel hacking
#       -> printk and dmesg options
#   Defined at lib/Kconfig.debug:167
