# CONFIG_X86_IOPL_IOPERM:
# 
# This enables the ioperm() and iopl() syscalls which are necessary
# for legacy applications.
# 
# Legacy IOPL support is an overbroad mechanism which allows user
# space aside of accessing all 65536 I/O ports also to disable
# interrupts. To gain this access the caller needs CAP_SYS_RAWIO
# capabilities and permission from potentially active security
# modules.
# 
# The emulation restricts the functionality of the syscall to
# only allowing the full range I/O port access, but prevents the
# ability to disable interrupts from user space which would be
# granted if the hardware IOPL mechanism would be used.
#
