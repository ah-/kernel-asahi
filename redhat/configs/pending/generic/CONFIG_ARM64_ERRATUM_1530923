# CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_1530923:
# 
# This option adds a workaround for ARM Cortex-A55 erratum 1530923.
# 
# Affected Cortex-A55 cores (r0p0, r0p1, r1p0, r2p0) could end-up with
# corrupted TLBs by speculating an AT instruction during a guest
# context switch.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_ERRATUM_1530923 [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Cortex-A55: Speculative AT instruction using out-of-context translation regime could cause subsequent request to generate an incorrect translation
#   Location:
