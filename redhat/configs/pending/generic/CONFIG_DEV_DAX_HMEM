# CONFIG_DEV_DAX_HMEM:
# 
# EFI 2.8 platforms, and others, may advertise 'specific purpose'
# memory. For example, a high bandwidth memory pool. The
# indication from platform firmware is meant to reserve the
# memory from typical usage by default. This driver creates
# device-dax instances for these memory ranges, and that also
# enables the possibility to assign them to the DEV_DAX_KMEM
# driver to override the reservation and add them to kernel
# "System RAM" pool.
# 
# Say M if unsure.
# 
# Symbol: DEV_DAX_HMEM [=m]
# Type  : tristate
# Prompt: HMEM DAX: direct access to 'specific purpose' memory
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> DAX: direct access to differentiated memory (DAX [=y])
#   Defined at drivers/dax/Kconfig:35
#   Depends on: DAX [=y] && EFI_SOFT_RESERVE [=y]
