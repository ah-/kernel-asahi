# CONFIG_TIPC_CRYPTO:
# 
# Saying Y here will enable support for TIPC encryption.
# All TIPC messages will be encrypted/decrypted by using the currently most
# advanced algorithm: AEAD AES-GCM (like IPSec or TLS) before leaving/
# entering the TIPC stack.
# Key setting from user-space is performed via netlink by a user program
# (e.g. the iproute2 'tipc' tool).
# 
# Symbol: TIPC_CRYPTO [=y]
