# CONFIG_MLXBF_BOOTCTL:
# 
# The Mellanox BlueField firmware implements functionality to
# request swapping the primary and alternate eMMC boot partition,
# and to set up a watchdog that can undo that swap if the system
# does not boot up correctly. This driver provides sysfs access
# to the userspace tools, to be used in conjunction with the eMMC
# device driver to do necessary initial swap of the boot partition.
