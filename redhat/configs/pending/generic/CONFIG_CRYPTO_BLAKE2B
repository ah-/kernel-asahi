# CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLAKE2B:
# 
# Implementation of cryptographic hash function BLAKE2b (or just BLAKE2),
# optimized for 64bit platforms and can produce digests of any size
# between 1 to 64.  The keyed hash is also implemented.
# 
# This module provides the following algorithms:
# 
# - blake2b-160
# - blake2b-256
# - blake2b-384
# - blake2b-512
# 
# See https://blake2.net for further information.
