# CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_COMPRESSED:
# 
# Compress the debug information using zlib.  Requires GCC 5.0+ or Clang
# 5.0+, binutils 2.26+, and zlib.
# 
# Users of dpkg-deb via scripts/package/builddeb may find an increase in
# size of their debug .deb packages with this config set, due to the
# debug info being compressed with zlib, then the object files being
# recompressed with a different compression scheme. But this is still
# preferable to setting $KDEB_COMPRESS to "none" which would be even
# larger.
