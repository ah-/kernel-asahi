# Say Y here if you want support for Goodix i2c devices that use
# the i2c-hid protocol on Open Firmware (Device Tree)-based
# systems.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
# 
# This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
# will be called i2c-hid-of-goodix.  It will also build/depend on
# the module i2c-hid.
