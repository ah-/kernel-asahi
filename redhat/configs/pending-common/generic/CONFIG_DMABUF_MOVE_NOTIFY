# CONFIG_DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY:
# 
# Don''t pin buffers if the dynamic DMA-buf interface is available on both the
# exporter as well as the importer. This fixes a security problem where
# userspace is able to pin unrestricted amounts of memory through DMA-buf.
# But marked experimental because we don''t jet have a consistent execution
# context and memory management between drivers.
# 
# Symbol: DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at drivers/dma-buf/Kconfig:42
#   Prompt: Move notify between drivers (EXPERIMENTAL)
