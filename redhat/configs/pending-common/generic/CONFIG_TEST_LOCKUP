# CONFIG_TEST_LOCKUP:
# 
# This builds the "test_lockup" module that helps to make sure
# that watchdogs and lockup detectors are working properly.
# 
# Depending on module parameters it could emulate soft or hard
# lockup, "hung task", or locking arbitrary lock for a long time.
# Also it could generate series of lockups with cooling-down periods.
# 
# If unsure, say N.

# Symbol: TEST_LOCKUP [=n]
