# CONFIG_NET_SCH_ETS:
# 
# The Enhanced Transmission Selection scheduler is a classful
# queuing discipline that merges functionality of PRIO and DRR
# qdiscs in one scheduler. ETS makes it easy to configure a set of
# strict and bandwidth-sharing bands to implement the transmission
# selection described in 802.1Qaz.
# 
# Say Y here if you want to use the ETS packet scheduling
# algorithm.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
# will be called sch_ets.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
