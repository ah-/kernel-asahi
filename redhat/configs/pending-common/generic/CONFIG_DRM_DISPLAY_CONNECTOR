# CONFIG_DRM_DISPLAY_CONNECTOR:
# 
# Driver for display connectors with support for DDC and hot-plug
# detection. Most display controller handle display connectors
# internally and don't need this driver, but the DRM subsystem is
# moving towards separating connector handling from display controllers
# on ARM-based platforms. Saying Y here when this driver is not needed
# will not cause any issue.
