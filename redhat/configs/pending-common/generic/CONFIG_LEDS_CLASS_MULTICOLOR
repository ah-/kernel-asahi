# CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR:
# 
# This option enables the multicolor LED sysfs class in /sys/class/leds.
# It wraps LED class and adds multicolor LED specific sysfs attributes
# and kernel internal API to it. You'll need this to provide support
# for multicolor LEDs that are grouped together. This class is not
# intended for single color LEDs. It can be built as a module.
