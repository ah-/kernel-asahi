# CONFIG_WIREGUARD:
# 
# WireGuard is a secure, fast, and easy to use replacement for IPSec
# that uses modern cryptography and clever networking tricks. It's
# designed to be fairly general purpose and abstract enough to fit most
# use cases, while at the same time remaining extremely simple to
# configure. See www.wireguard.com for more info.
# 
# It's safe to say Y or M here, as the driver is very lightweight and
# is only in use when an administrator chooses to add an interface.
