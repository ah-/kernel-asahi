# CONFIG_PROVE_RAW_LOCK_NESTING:
# 
# Enable the raw_spinlock vs. spinlock nesting checks which ensure
# that the lock nesting rules for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels are
# not violated.
# 
# NOTE: There are known nesting problems. So if you enable this
# option expect lockdep splats until these problems have been fully
# addressed which is work in progress. This config switch allows to
# identify and analyze these problems. It will be removed and the
# check permanentely enabled once the main issues have been fixed.
# 
# If unsure, select N.
