# If you have a network (Ethernet) chipset belonging to this class,
# say Y.
# 
# Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
# the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
# the questions regarding Broadcom chipsets. If you say Y, you will
# be asked for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.
