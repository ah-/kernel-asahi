# CONFIG_ARM64_AMU_EXTN:
# 
# The activity monitors extension is an optional extension introduced
# by the ARMv8.4 CPU architecture. This enables support for version 1
# of the activity monitors architecture, AMUv1.
# 
# To enable the use of this extension on CPUs that implement it, say Y.
# 
# Note that for architectural reasons, firmware _must_ implement AMU
# support when running on CPUs that present the activity monitors
# extension. The required support is present in:
#   * Version 1.5 and later of the ARM Trusted Firmware
# 
# For kernels that have this configuration enabled but boot with broken
# firmware, you may need to say N here until the firmware is fixed.
# Otherwise you may experience firmware panics or lockups when
# accessing the counter registers. Even if you are not observing these
# symptoms, the values returned by the register reads might not
# correctly reflect reality. Most commonly, the value read will be 0,
# indicating that the counter is not enabled.
#
