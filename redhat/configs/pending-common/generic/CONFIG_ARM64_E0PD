# CONFIG_ARM64_E0PD:
# 
# E0PD (part of the ARMv8.5 extensions) allows us to ensure
# that EL0 accesses made via TTBR1 always fault in constant time,
# providing similar benefits to KASLR as those provided by KPTI, but
# with lower overhead and without disrupting legitimate access to
# kernel memory such as SPE.
# 
# This option enables E0PD for TTBR1 where available.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_E0PD [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Enable support for E0PD
#   Location:
#     -> Kernel Features
