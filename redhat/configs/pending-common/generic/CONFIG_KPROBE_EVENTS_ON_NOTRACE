# CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS_ON_NOTRACE:
# 
# This is only for the developers who want to debug ftrace itself
# using kprobe events.
# 
# If kprobes can use ftrace instead of breakpoint, ftrace related
# functions are protected from kprobe-events to prevent an infinit
# recursion or any unexpected execution path which leads to a kernel
# crash.
# 
# This option disables such protection and allows you to put kprobe
# events on ftrace functions for debugging ftrace by itself.
# Note that this might let you shoot yourself in the foot.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
# 
# Symbol: KPROBE_EVENTS_ON_NOTRACE [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at kernel/trace/Kconfig:550
#   Prompt: Do NOT protect notrace function from kprobe events
