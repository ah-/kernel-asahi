# CONFIG_ARM64_USE_LSE_ATOMICS:
# 
# As part of the Large System Extensions, ARMv8.1 introduces new
# atomic instructions that are designed specifically to scale in
# very large systems.
# 
# Say Y here to make use of these instructions for the in-kernel
# atomic routines. This incurs a small overhead on CPUs that do
# not support these instructions and requires the kernel to be
# built with binutils >= 2.25 in order for the new instructions
# to be used.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_USE_LSE_ATOMICS [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Prompt: Atomic instructions
