# CONFIG_PING:
# 
# Say Y here to build a driver for GPIO bitbanged ranger sensors
# with just one GPIO for the trigger and echo. This driver can be
# used to measure the distance of objects.
# 
# Actually supported are:
# - Parallax PING))) (ultrasonic)
# - Parallax LaserPING (time-of-flight)
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
# module will be called ping.
# 
# Symbol: PING [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/iio/proximity/Kconfig:61
#   Prompt: Parallax GPIO bitbanged ranger sensors
#   Depends on: IIO [=m] && GPIOLIB [=y]
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Industrial I/O support (IIO [=m])
#         -> Proximity and distance sensors

# CONFIG_PING is not set
