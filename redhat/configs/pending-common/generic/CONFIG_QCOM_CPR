# CONFIG_QCOM_CPR:
# 
# Say Y here to enable support for the CPR hardware found on Qualcomm
# SoCs like QCS404.
# 
# This driver populates CPU OPPs tables and makes adjustments to the
# tables based on feedback from the CPR hardware. If you want to do
# CPUfrequency scaling say Y here.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
# be called qcom-cpr
