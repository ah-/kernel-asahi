# CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_CCTRNG:
# 
# Say 'Y' to enable the True Random Number Generator driver for the
# Arm TrustZone CryptoCell family of processors.
# Currently the CryptoCell 713 and 703 are supported.
# The driver is supported only in SoC where Trusted Execution
# Environment is not used.
# Choose 'M' to compile this driver as a module. The module
# will be called cctrng.
# If unsure, say 'N'.
