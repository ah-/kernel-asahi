# CONFIG_OSNOISE_TRACER:
# 
# In the context of high-performance computing (HPC), the Operating
# System Noise (osnoise) refers to the interference experienced by an
# application due to activities inside the operating system. In the
# context of Linux, NMIs, IRQs, SoftIRQs, and any other system thread
# can cause noise to the system. Moreover, hardware-related jobs can
# also cause noise, for example, via SMIs.
# 
# The osnoise tracer leverages the hwlat_detector by running a similar
# loop with preemption, SoftIRQs and IRQs enabled, thus allowing all
# the sources of osnoise during its execution. The osnoise tracer takes
# note of the entry and exit point of any source of interferences,
# increasing a per-cpu interference counter. It saves an interference
# counter for each source of interference. The interference counter for
# NMI, IRQs, SoftIRQs, and threads is increased anytime the tool
# observes these interferences' entry events. When a noise happens
# without any interference from the operating system level, the
# hardware noise counter increases, pointing to a hardware-related
# noise. In this way, osnoise can account for any source of
# interference. At the end of the period, the osnoise tracer prints
# the sum of all noise, the max single noise, the percentage of CPU
# available for the thread, and the counters for the noise sources.
# 
# In addition to the tracer, a set of tracepoints were added to
# facilitate the identification of the osnoise source.
# 
# The output will appear in the trace and trace_pipe files.
# 
# To enable this tracer, echo in "osnoise" into the current_tracer
# file.
