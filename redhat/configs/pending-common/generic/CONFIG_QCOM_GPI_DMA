# CONFIG_QCOM_GPI_DMA:
# 
# Enable support for the QCOM GPI DMA controller. This controller
# provides DMA capabilities for a variety of peripheral buses such
# as I2C, UART, and SPI. By using GPI dmaengine driver, bus drivers
# can use a standardize interface that is protocol independent to
# transfer data between DDR and peripheral.
