# CONFIG_FB_ARMCLCD:
# 
# This framebuffer device driver is for the ARM PrimeCell PL110
# Colour LCD controller.  ARM PrimeCells provide the building
# blocks for System on a Chip devices.
# 
# If you want to compile this as a module (=code which can be
# inserted into and removed from the running kernel), say M
# here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.rst>.  The module
# will be called amba-clcd.
