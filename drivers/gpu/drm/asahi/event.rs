//! GPU event manager
//!
//! The GPU firmware manages work completion by using event objects (Apple calls them "stamps"),
//! which are monotonically incrementing counters. There are a fixed number of objects, and
//! they are managed with a `SlotAllocator`.
//!
//! This module manages the set of available events and lets users compute expected values.
//! It also manages signaling owners when the GPU firmware reports that an event fired.
