	  The PMGR block in Apple SoCs provides high-level power state
	  controls for SoC devices. This driver manages them through the
	  generic power domain framework, and also provides reset support.

	help
	  Apple SoCs have various co-processors required for certain
	  peripherals to work (NVMe, display controller, etc.). This
	  driver adds support for the mailbox controller used to
	  communicate with those.

	  Say Y here if you have a Apple SoC.

	help
	  Apple SoCs such as the M1 come with various co-processors running
	  their proprietary RTKit operating system. This option enables support
	  for the protocol library used to communicate with those. It is used
	  by various client drivers.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.

config APPLE_SART

	help
	  Apple SART is a simple DMA address filter used on Apple SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usually required for the NVMe coprocessor which does
	  not use a proper IOMMU.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.
