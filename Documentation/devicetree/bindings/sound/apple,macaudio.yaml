              DAI list with the CODEC-side DAIs connected to the above CPU-side
              DAIs and involved in this sound peripheral.

              The list is in left/right order if applicable. If there are more
              than one CPU-side DAIs (there can be two), the CODECs must be
              listed first those connected to the first CPU, then those
              connected to the second.

              In addition, on some machines with many speaker codecs, the CODECs
              are listed in this fixed order:

              J293: Left Front, Left Rear, Right Front, Right Rear
              J314: Left Woofer 1, Left Tweeter, Left Woofer 2,
                    Right Woofer 1, Right Tweeter, Right Woofer 2
