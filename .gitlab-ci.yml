# CI definitions for ark-patches and internal are maintained in a single file
# outside the main repository because the two branches are regularly merged
# together in release branches. Rather than trying to keep the two branches in
# sync or have merge conflicts each time we merge the two branches, the
# definition is stored externally and included in each branch.
#
# To update any CI jobs, please submit any merge requests to
# https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark-ci/.
